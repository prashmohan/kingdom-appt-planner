In the high-stakes world of **Kingdom vs Kingdom (KvK)**, timing isn't just everything—it's the *only* thing. The **Kingdom Appointment Planner** is a specialized strategic tool designed to synchronize your strongest players with the kingdom's "King's Buffs," ensuring every second of that 30-minute window translates into maximum points.

## 🎯 Why Use the Planner?

Managing a kingdom of hundreds of players manually is a nightmare. This tool automates the heavy lifting:

*   **Eliminate Spreadsheet Fatigue:** No more manual data entry or juggling conflicting time zones.
*   **Optimal Resource Utilization:** Our "Protected Greedy Algorithm" automatically identifies and assigns players with the highest potential point contribution.
*   **Fair & Transparent:** Clear, publicly accessible schedules ensure everyone knows when it's their time to shine.
*   **Full Admin Control:** Balance automation with manual overrides for high-priority VIPs or special circumstances.

## 🧠 The "Protected Greedy" Algorithm

To ensure the Kingdom generates the absolute maximum points during KvK, the planner uses a specialized optimization strategy:

1.  **Scoring:** Every player is assigned a "Potential Score" based on their available speedups and rare resources (like TrueGold).
2.  **Ranking:** The algorithm sorts all submissions from highest score to lowest.
3.  **Greedy Assignment:** Starting with the highest-ranked player, the system searches for an open slot that matches the player's submitted availability.
4.  **Protection (Locking):** Administrators can "Lock" any appointment. The algorithm treats locked slots as immutable—it will never move a locked player, even if a higher-scoring player becomes available later. This allows leadership to guarantee slots for critical contributors while letting the algorithm handle the rest.

## 📖 Administrator's Guide

### Step 1: Launch your Event
Give your event a name (e.g., "KvK Season 12") and select whether your kingdom runs Research on **Day 2** or **Day 5**. Save the **Admin URL**—this is your private key!

### Step 2: Data Collection & Verification
Share the **Player URL** with your kingdom. 

*   **Verification:** Encourage players to upload screenshots of their backpack. You can view these images directly in the Admin Dashboard to verify their resource claims.
*   **Live Updates:** If a player earns more speedups, they can simply use the link again. The system recognizes their Player ID and updates their existing entry.

### Step 3: Optimization
Click **Assign Appointments**. The system will fill the slots, prioritizing players with the most resources. Review the results, make manual tweaks if needed, and "Lock" the slots you are happy with.

### Step 4: Go Live!
Share the **Finalized Schedule URL**. It's read-only and always reflects your latest locked/assigned appointments.
